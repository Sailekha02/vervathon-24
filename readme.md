Team name- Eternalites
problem statement- 3D model generation fron text(generative AI)
Team leader email-sailekha.mathes@gmail.com

A brief of the prototype:
This text-to-3D image generation prototype is a simple web application that takes a userâ€™s text input, processes it with a Generative AI model, and returns a generated 3D image based on that input. 

Tech Stack:
we have used frontend and backend technologies.
*frontend-HTML(to structure the web page)
*backend-Python and FLask
*Ai models and libraries(Pytorch)
*image processing and encoding(Base64,PIL)
*Communication and data transfer(JSON)

What I learned:
during this Hackathon, i had learnt how to analyse a problem statement carefully and fully understand how to explore into the world of coding. Since this was my first ever hackathon, i found out what hackathon is and has really given me a great experience and has motivated me to participate in more hackathons.
